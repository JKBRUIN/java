/** CSD320
 * Module 2 Assignment 2
 * Jeremiah Kellam

 * 
 * Assignment:
 * Write a program that calculates the energy needed to 
 * heat water from an initial temperature to a final temperature.
 * Your program should prompt the user to enter the amount of water 
 * in kilograms and the initial and final temperature of the water.
 * The formula to use for this program is:
 * Q = waterMass ( finalTemperature â€“ initialTemperature ) x 4184
